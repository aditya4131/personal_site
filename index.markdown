## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at Louisiana State University, driven by a passion for research, innovation, and technology. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively contributed to impactful projects, including collaborative work on a language model for cancer pathology report summarization. As a Research Assistant at LSU Mobile Device Security Lab, I've explored privacy implications of trackers and led analyses. During internships at Chevron, I played a pivotal role in developing Python-based file scrapers, contributing to the company's efficiency. Proficient in Python, Java, C++, and more, I am eager to leverage my skills to make meaningful contributions in the dynamic landscape of computer science and technology.
